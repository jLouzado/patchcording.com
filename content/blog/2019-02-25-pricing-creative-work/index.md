If you've already had atleast a couple of clients, and you feel like you're being underpaid, this one's for you.

Personally, I'm talking about Programming when I say `Creative Work` but this is applicable to any Creative Process you're trying to get paid for.

## The Short Answer

As [@patio11] likes to say, "Charge More!". Double your rates until someone says 'No'.

> Note: His [Salary Negotation] and [Don't Call Yourself A Programmer] articles are amazing resources btw.

This is a lot of work, yes. It will be taxing on your time and your emotional fortitude but hey, you're the one complaining.

## My (Longer) Version

The trouble with economics is that it thinks of all of us as perfectly rational, ruthlessly self-maximizing agents. In reality, things are much more complicated for creative work and creative people:

- We're emotionally attached to our work, _so we overcommit_
- We want people to like us and our work, _so we become people-pleasers_
- We compare ourselves to the best in the field, _so we **undervalue ourselves**!_

## A Vicious Cycle

When someone is trying to earn more, the cycle usually goes something like this:

1. Raise rates.
1. Client will (reasonably) ask why they're paying more
1. Panic, and start promising to do more (start justifying the rate)
1. Wind up doing more work, which takes longer to complete.
1. Effective hourly-rate is actually the same (or more likely, even lower)
1. Get Frustrated about being underpaid. Cycle back to 1st step.

## Use a 2-phase approach

There's nothing inherantly wrong with doing more work to justify a higher rate. It's just that you're not solving your original complaint.

As such there are two separate questions you're trying to answer so investigate them separately:

### Phase 1 - What's my _Current_ market-value?

- You're doing a certain amount of work (say `X` units).
- You're currently charging \$10 for it.
- Double that to $20 for new customers or charge $10 for a new project half the size (`X/2` units).
- Repeat until you get consistently rejected, then negotiate. Let's say that finally you get to about \$30 for `X` units of work.

> Note: We'll talk in a separate article about what `X` might be and how to estimate it.

This is the current market value of what you're doing. This is the step that most people skip, because most business-writing is focused on the next phase.

### Phase 2 - How can I increase my market-value?

- Once you have your \$30 rate, here is where you start offering more "value-added" services.
- For software maybe that means [Better Architecture](https://youtu.be/DngAZyWMGR0) with better code-quality, automated tests, documentation (things users might not immediately see)
- For something like photography maybe that means custom colour-grading for particular clients so they get faster turn-around times. Maybe better customer support, whatever your thing is. Get creative. :)

## Should you Ease off the brakes or press on the Gas-pedal?

Imagine you're in a car, with both the brake and gas pedal at half-pressed. You want to go faster; do you ease off the brakes or press down on the gas?

I heard this analogy somewhere a long time ago (can't remember where) but it really struck a chord with me. When I was younger I think I had more energy and would just default into pressing on the gas. But that way be dragons (and burnout), and as I'm getting older I'm finding much greater returns from removing blockers (internal and external) instead.

## Summary

`Phase 1` is about easing off the brakes, `Phase 2` is about pressing down on the gas. I'd say go easy on the second till you've made progress with the first but ultimately it's up to you.

And remember, the market value of your work is separate from _your_ value. Don't confuse the two.

Good luck out there. :)
